	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Most {US} adults are overweight or obese. Understanding differences in obesity prevalence across subpopulations could facilitate the development and dissemination of weight management services. {OBJECTIVES}: To inform Veterans Health Administration ({VHA}) weight management initiatives, we describe obesity prevalence among subpopulations of {VHA} patients. {DESIGN}: Cross-sectional descriptive analyses of fiscal year 2014 ({FY}2014) national {VHA} administrative and clinical data, stratified by gender. Differences ≥5\% higher than the population mean were considered clinically significant. {PARTICIPANTS}: Veteran {VHA} primary care patients with a valid weight within ±365 days of their first {FY}2014 primary care visit, and a valid height (98\% of primary care patients). {MAIN} {MEASURES}: We used {VHA} vital signs data to ascertain height and weight and calculate body mass index, and {VHA} outpatient, inpatient, and fee basis data to identify sociodemographic- and comorbidity-based subpopulations. {KEY} {RESULTS}: Among nearly five million primary care patients (347,112 women, 4,567,096 men), obesity prevalence was 41\% (women 44\%, men 41\%), and overweight prevalence was 37\% (women 31\%, men 38\%). Across the {VHA}’s 140 facilities, obesity prevalence ranged from 28\% to 49\%. Among gender-stratified subpopulations, obesity prevalence was high among veterans under age 65 (age 18-44: women 40\%, men 46\%; age 45-64: women 49\%, men 48\%). Obesity prevalence varied across racial/ethnic and comorbidity subpopulations, with high obesity prevalence among black women (51\%), women with schizophrenia (56\%), and women and men with diabetes (68\%, 56\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Overweight and obesity are common among veterans served by the {VHA}. {VHA}’s weight management initiatives have the potential to avert long-term},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: For more than a decade, the Veterans Health Administration ({VHA}) has offered {MOVE}!, a comprehensive lifestyle intervention for weight management. However, there is limited knowledge to inform resource allocation decisions at the health system level—for example, the choice between reaching new veterans with weight management treatment, re-engaging veterans who have stopped attending, and/or increasing contact with current {MOVE}! participants. {OBJECTIVE}: To inform {VHA} policy and planning, this {VHA}-wide study examines the relationship between {MOVE}! participation and weight outcomes. {DESIGN}: A longitudinal observational study of veterans across {VHA} who participated in {MOVE}!. {PARTICIPANTS}: Veterans who initiated their most recent episode of {MOVE}! care between 2004 and 2014. {MAIN} {MEASURES}: Weight measurements were abstracted from {VHA} electronic health records. The primary outcome was the proportion of veterans with clinically relevant weight loss. The predictor of interest was number of {MOVE}! contacts during the 12 months following {MOVE}! initiation. {KEY} {RESULTS}: The cohort consisted of 237,577 veterans (87.4\% male; mean age 54.4 years), who had 5.3 contacts on average in the 12 months following initiation. Veterans with 2–5 contacts had the same odds of achieving clinically relevant weight loss as veterans with only one contact (adjusted {OR}: 1.00, 95\% {CI}: 0.98–1.03). Veterans with 6–9, 10–13, 14–17, and 18 or more contacts had significantly higher odds of clinically relevant weight loss (adjusted {OR}: 1.17, 95\% {CI}: 1.13–1.20; adjusted {OR}: 1.53, 95\% {CI}: 1.47–1.59; adjusted {OR}: 1.84, 95\% {CI}: 1.74–1.94; adjusted {OR}: 2.21, 95\% {CI}: 2.12–2.31, respectively). {CONCLUSIONS}: Veterans with ≥6 {MOVE}! contacts in the year following treatment initiation were significantly more likely to achieve clinically relevant weight loss than those with one contact, with greater participation further increasing the odds of clinically relevant weight loss. While further characterization of weight loss predictors is needed, the {VHA} should provide policy guidance that supports increasing participation among veterans who have initiated {MOVE}!.},

	abstract = {Methods: This observational study evaluated weight loss by {SDB} status in overweight/obese veterans enrolled in {MOVE}! from May 2008–February 2012 who had at least two {MOVE}! visits, baseline weight, and at least one follow-up weight (n = 84,770). {SDB} was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcome was weight change (lb) from {MOVE}! enrollment to 6- and 12-mo assessments. Weight change over time was modeled with repeated-measures analyses. Results: {SDB} was diagnosed in one-third of the cohort (n = 28,269). At baseline, veterans with {SDB} weighed 29 [48] lb more than those without {SDB} (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). On average, veterans attended eight {MOVE}! visits. Weight loss patterns over time were statistically different between veterans with and without {SDB} (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001); veterans with {SDB} lost less weight (−2.5 [0.1] lb) compared to those without {SDB} (−3.3 [0.1] lb; P = 0.001) at 6 months. At 12 mo, veterans with {SDB} continued to lose weight whereas veterans without {SDB} started to re-gain weight. Conclusions: Veterans with sleep disordered breathing ({SDB}) had significantly less weight loss over time than veterans without {SDB}. {SDB} should be considered in the development and implementation of weight loss programs due to its high prevalence and negative effect on health.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity is a substantial problem in the Veterans Health Administration ({VHA}). {VHA} developed and disseminated the {MOVE}! Weight Management Program for Veterans to its medical facilities but implementation of the program has been variable. Purpose: The objective was to explore variation in {MOVE}! program implementation to identify facility structure, policies, and processes associated with larger patient weight-loss outcomes. Methods: Qualitative comparative analysis ({QCA}) was used to identify facility conditions or combinations of conditions associated with larger 6-month patient weight-loss outcomes. {QCA} is a method that allows for systematic cross-case comparison to better understand causal complexity. Eleven sites with larger outcomes and 11 sites with smaller outcomes were identifıed and data were collected with site interviews, facility-completed program summary forms, and medical record abstraction in 2009 and 2010. Conditions were selected based on theory and experience implementing {MOVE}! and were calibrated using {QCA} methods. Confıguration patterns were examined to identify necessary conditions (i.e., always present when outcome present, but alone do not guarantee outcome) and suffıcient conditions (i.e., presence guarantees outcome) at sites with larger and smaller outcomes. A thematic analysis of site interview data supplemented {QCA} fındings. Results: No two sites shared the same condition pattern. Necessary conditions included the use of a standard curriculum and group care-delivery format, and they were present at all sites with larger outcomes but at only six sites with smaller outcomes. At the 17 sites with both necessary conditions, four combinations of conditions were identifıed that accounted for all sites with larger outcomes. These included high program complexity combined with high staff involvement; group care-delivery format combined with low accountability to facility leadership; an active physician champion combined with low accountability to facility leadership; and the use of quality-improvement strategies combined with not using a waiting list. Conclusions: The use of a standard curriculum delivered with a group care-delivery format is an essential feature of successful {VHA} facility {MOVE}! Weight Management Programs, but alone does not guarantee success. Program development and policy will be used to ensure dissemination of the best practices identifıed in this evaluation.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to see whether patients in a real-world setting taking topiramate for varied indications experience signiﬁcant weight loss. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study from the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. Patients were new topiramate users between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2013 with body mass index {\textbackslash}textgreater 25 kg/m2 and medication possession ratio {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.5. Primary outcome determined if topiramate users experienced signiﬁcant changes in weight and body mass index. Secondary outcome analyzed predictive factors associated with 5\% weight loss using logistic regression models. Patients were followed up 1 year post index date. Results: A total of 767 patients were included in the ﬁnal analysis. Patients lost an average of 5.6 lbs (216.1 lbs preweight vs. 210.5 lbs postweight) at an average follow-up of 7.8 months. A total of 43.2\% (92/213) of females lost 5\% of their body weight compared to 29.4\% (163/554) of males.

Methods: We used chart-reviewed, clinical and administrative {VHA} data from ﬁscal years 2010–2012 to estimate obesity screening and participation in the {VHA}’s weight management program ({MOVE}!) across groups. Six- and 12-month weight changes in {MOVE}! participants were estimated using linear mixed models adjusted for confounders. Results: Compared to individuals without {SMI}/{DD}, individuals with {SMI} or {DD} were less frequently screened for obesity (94\%–94.7\% vs. 95.7\%) but had greater participation in {MOVE}!

We used national {VHA} administrative sociodemo-graphic data, tracked veteran {BMI} for 6 years, and used trajectory modeling to identify {BMI} trajectories and sociodemographic characteristics associated with trajectory membership. Results—Five trajectory groups determined in the full sample were primarily differentiated by their post-deployment initial {BMI}: “healthy” (14.1\%), “overweight” (36.3\%), “borderline obese” (27.9\%), “obese” (15.7\%), and “severely obese” (6.0).

The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with longterm changes in {BMI}. Methods—Subjects with {RA} from the Veterans Affairs ({VA}) Rheumatoid Arthritis ({VARA}) Registry (n = 1474) were studied. Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were extracted from the {VARA} database. {BMI} was extracted from {VA} electronic medical records within 14 days of each visit date. {VA} pharmacy records were queried to identify prescriptions for specific {RA} therapies within 1 month of the visit date. We used robust generalized estimating equations marginal regression models to calculate independent associations between clinical variables and {BMI} over time. Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss over the subsequent study observation period. Results—Increasing age, active smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower {BMI}. Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater reductions in {BMI} over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher {BMI}, and less subsequent improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not associated with change in {BMI} or the risk of weight loss independent of other factors.

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the degree of weight loss in subjects enrolled in the Veterans Affairs weight management program ({MOVE}!). Design: Retrospective cohort design. Setting: Tertiary care {US} veterans hospital, July, 2007 to September, 2008, using a retrospective database. Participants: Adult veterans (n ¼ 1,659), mostly men (85\%). Intervention: Encounters with existing nutrition education classes were collected and outcomes were assessed. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was weight change; the predictor was visits or encounters. Analysis: One-way {ANOVA}. Results: In this sample, \$ 3 nutrition education encounters were associated with signiﬁcantly more body weight loss compared with 1–2 encounters or no education (–1.62\%, 0.2\%, and –0.23\%, respectively; P ¼ .01). Conclusions and Implications: Three or more nutrition education encounters within the {MOVE}! weight management program at the Michael E. {DeBakey} Veterans Affairs Medical Center are associated with modest weight loss. Future prospective studies are needed to determine causality and conﬁrm these ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {Obesity is a common health problem for veterans. This study explored background and program characteristics associated with a 5\% weight reduction for veterans enrolled in {MOVE}!®, a weight management program. For data analysis, 404 veteran records were examined using logistic regression. Background characteristics included socio-demographic variables, comorbidity, body mass index, rurality, and Veterans Administration ({VA}) priority group. Program characteristics included the program type (group attendee or self-managed) as well as the number and type of provider contacts. Thirteen percent of participants achieved a 5\% weight reduction. Age in years (odds ratio [{OR}] = 1.04) and the number of group visits ({OR} = 1.05) were significant predictors for achieving a 5\% weight reduction. Given the importance of weight reduction, health professionals should consider these significant predictors when planning weight-reduction programs for veterans.},

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of high-intensity treatment with the behavioral weight reduction program, {MOVE}!®, available at Veterans Administration Medical Centers, on achieving at least a 5\% weight reduction 6 months after enrolling in the program. {MOVE}!® is free to veterans but little is known about the recommended number of sessions. Design and Sample: Using longitudinal clinical data from electronic health records of 216 {MOVE}!® program participants, weight reduction was examined in this secondary data analysis. Measures: Based on the 2013 guidelines for overweight and obesity management, weights were evaluated at baseline and 6 months following enrollment in the program, and high-intensity {MOVE}!® was determined by attending 14 or more sessions within the first 6 months following enrollment. Results: High-intensity {MOVE}!® participants were five times as likely to achieve at least the 5\% weight reduction goal at 6 months compared to those participants with low intensity, while controlling for age, gender, and race ({OR} = 4.74; {CI}: 1.3, 17.2; p {\textbackslash}textless .02). Conclusion: This research supports the 2013 recommendations for high-intensity lifestyle intervention as participants who completed 14 or more sessions were almost five times more likely to achieve a 5\% weight reduction.},
